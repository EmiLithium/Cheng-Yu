Will modify this later when I figure out the workflow of joining data to the main dataframe. 
For now, the below guidelines are modified from GitHubs's [gitignore contribution guidelines](https://github.com/github/gitignore/edit/master/README.md)) 
and are also available in the [README](./README.md).

# Contributing guidelines

I'd love more idioms to be added to this dataframe. To keep the quality as high 
as possible, I would like contributions to adhere to the following guidelines 
(modeled after GitHubs's [gitignore contribution guidelines](https://github.com/github/gitignore/edit/master/README.md)).

- **Provide links to documentation** supporting the change you’re making.
  If documentation isn’t available to support your change, do the best you can
  to explain why you are making the change, even if it seems self-evident.

In general, the more you can do to help me understand the change you’re making,
the more likely I’ll be to accept your contribution quickly.

# Contributing workflow

Here is a workflow GitHub suggests for proposing changes to other people's projects:

1. [Fork this project][fork] to your account.
2. [Create a branch][branch] for the change you intend to make.
3. Make your changes to your fork.
4. [Send a pull request][pr] from your fork’s branch to my `master` branch.

Using the web-based interface to make changes is fine too, and will automatically 
fork the project and prompt you to send a pull request.
